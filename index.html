                        quantum entanglement, Grover's Algorithm, Quantum Fourier Transform,
                        Quantum Phase Estimation, Shor's Algorithm. The project I made was an extended version
                        of Bloch Duel (see: Accomplishments: QJam 2021). The course was finished with distinction
                        for being in top 10% of students who finished the course.
